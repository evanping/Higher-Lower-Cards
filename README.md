Recreating a previous personal project: a baseball version of the Higher Lower Game with MLB stats. Very simple, not even any database calls - also started with typescript but got lazy cause this is a weekend project ðŸ’€

### Tech

- Next.js 13 (app router honestly bit of a pain, might stick to /pages for a bit)
- Actually used framer motion for the first time, will probably use it again
- More tailwind hurhur
